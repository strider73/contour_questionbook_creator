  7. Simplify right side to get $r^2$
  8. Identify center $(h, k)$ and radius $r$
- **Example Problem Types**: Questions 16, 17 (circle conversions)
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid**: Sign errors when completing square, forgetting to add to both sides, arithmetic errors

### Strategy 10: Circle Sketching from Standard Form
- **When Used**: Graphing a circle given its equation
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify center $(h, k)$ from $(x-h)^2 + (y-k)^2 = r^2$
  2. Calculate radius: $r = \sqrt{r^2}$
  3. Plot center point
  4. From center, move radius distance in 4 directions (up, down, left, right)
  5. Plot these 4 key points
  6. Find intercepts if needed: set $x=0$ for y-intercepts, $y=0$ for x-intercepts
  7. Draw smooth circle through all points
  8. Label center, radius, and key points with coordinates
- **Example Problem Types**: Questions 15, 16, 17 (circle sketching)
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid**: Wrong center signs, incorrect radius calculation, non-circular shape

## 7. Visual Diagram Patterns

### 7.1 Diagram Configuration → Concept Mapping

| Concept/Theorem | Diagram Configuration | Key Visual Elements | How to Recognize |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| Function vs Relation | Table with x and y columns | Each x-value paired with y-value(s) | If any x repeats with different y → relation. If each x appears once → function |
| Vertical Line Test | Graph on coordinate plane | Various curve types | Draw imaginary vertical lines. If any intersects curve twice → not function |
| Set Elements | Bag/collection diagram with numbered balls | Numbers in visual container | Numbers represent discrete elements in set |
| Interval on Number Line | Horizontal line with marked points | Open circles (non-inclusive), closed circles (inclusive), shaded region between | Shading shows included values, circle type shows endpoint inclusion |
| Union of Intervals | Two overlapping shaded regions on number line | Separate shaded regions combining | Combined shading spans from leftmost to rightmost point |
| Intersection of Intervals | Overlapping portion of two shaded regions | Only doubly-shaded area counts | Result is only where both intervals overlap |
| Square Root Function | Curved graph starting at point, extending right-upward | Starting point (h, k), curve increases to right | Starts at specific point, grows like half-parabola sideways |
| Square Root Reflection | Curved graph with different orientations | Curve direction changes (up-right vs down-right vs up-left vs down-left) | Negative 'a' flips vertically, negative 'b' flips horizontally |
| Rectangular Hyperbola | Two separate curve branches with asymptotes | Dashed vertical and horizontal lines, curves in opposite quadrants | Curves approach but never touch dashed lines (asymptotes) |
| Hyperbola Intercepts | Points where hyperbola crosses axes | Labeled points on x-axis and y-axis | Curves pass through these specific coordinate points |
| Circle (Standard Form) | Circular shape centered at point | Center point, radius lines to edge, key points at cardinal directions | Perfect circle with marked center and 4 key points (up, down, left, right) |
| Circle Intercepts | Points where circle crosses axes | Labeled intersection points with coordinate axes | Circle crosses axes at specific calculable points |

### 7.2 Visual Elements and Their Meaning

| Visual Element | What It Indicates | Testing Aspect |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Table with repeated x-value** | Not a function (fails vertical line test) | Student must recognize one-to-one correspondence |
| **Open circle on number line** | Boundary not included (parenthesis notation) | Understanding of inclusive vs non-inclusive |
| **Closed circle on number line** | Boundary included (bracket notation) | Understanding of inclusive vs non-inclusive |
| **Shaded region on number line** | Values included in interval/set | Visual representation of domain/range |
| **Dashed line (asymptote)** | Line that curve approaches but never touches | Identifying limiting behavior of functions |
| **Solid curve** | The actual function graph | Distinguishing function from asymptotes |
| **Labeled point (x, y)** | Specific coordinate student should identify | Intercepts, turning points, key features |
| **Coordinate axes with grid** | Graph to be sketched | Student must draw accurate function shape |
| **Arrow on curve** | Direction of function behavior | Indicates function continues infinitely |
| **Center point marked** | Circle center or function center | Reference point for transformations |
| **Radius line** | Distance from center to edge | Measurement of circle size |

### 7.3 Standard Diagram Patterns by Topic

**Functions and Correspondence:**
```
Pattern: Table or Graph → Function Determination
├── Table with unique x-values → Function
├── Table with repeated x-values → Not a function (relation)
├── Graph passing vertical line test → Function
└── Graph failing vertical line test → Not a function
```

**Set Operations:**
```
Pattern: Number Line or List → Combined Set
├── Two separate lists → Union combines all unique elements
├── Two separate lists → Intersection finds common elements
├── Two separate lists → Difference removes second from first
└── Visual bag with numbered balls → Concrete set representation
```

**Interval Operations:**
```
Pattern: Number Line with Shaded Regions
├── Two intervals side-by-side → Union spans entire range
├── Two intervals overlapping → Intersection is overlap only
├── Parentheses boundary → Open circle (not included)
└── Bracket boundary → Closed circle (included)
```

**Square Root Functions:**
```
Pattern: Transformed Square Root Curve
├── Standard (a > 0, b > 0) → Starts bottom-left, curves up-right
├── x-axis reflection (a < 0) → Starts top-left, curves down-right
├── y-axis reflection (b < 0) → Starts bottom-right, curves up-left
└── Both reflections (a < 0, b < 0) → Starts top-right, curves down-left
```

**Hyperbola:**
```
Pattern: Two-Branch Curve with Asymptotes
├── Positive 'a' → Branches in quadrants I and III (positive correlation)
├── Negative 'a' → Branches in quadrants II and IV (negative correlation)
├── Vertical asymptote at x = h → Vertical dashed line
└── Horizontal asymptote at y = k → Horizontal dashed line
```

**Circles:**
```
Pattern: Circular Shape with Key Features
├── Center at (h, k) → Marked center point
├── Radius r → Distance from center to edge
├── Four cardinal points → (h±r, k) and (h, k±r)
└── Intercepts → Where circle crosses axes (found by substitution)
```

### 7.4 Diagram Variations in Workbook

| Concept | Variation 1 | Variation 2 | Variation 3 |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Function identification | Table format | Smooth curve graph | Piecewise graph |
| Interval notation | Union of non-overlapping intervals | Union of overlapping intervals | Intersection of intervals |
| Square root function | Standard orientation (up-right) | Reflected in x-axis (down-right) | With vertical and horizontal shift |
| Hyperbola | Standard reciprocal (origin-centered) | Translated horizontally and vertically | With intercepts labeled |
| Circle | Standard form directly given | General form requiring completing square | With line intersection (application) |
| Domain/range | From equation (calculate) | From graph (read visually) | From restricted function notation |

**Pedagogical Pattern**: Workbook progresses from:
1. **Recognition** (identify from given information)
2. **Calculation** (apply formulas to find features)
3. **Graphing** (create visual representation with labels)
4. **Application** (use concepts in real-world context)

This allows the question generator to choose DIFFERENT but VALID diagram configurations that test the SAME concept at appropriate difficulty levels.

### ADDITIONAL GUIDELINES:

**For Set Questions:**
- Define sets clearly with conditions (e.g., "less than 30", "perfect squares")
- Use realistic set sizes (5-10 elements typical)
- Ensure operations produce meaningful results (intersection not empty unless intentional)

**For Interval Questions:**
- Use integer or half-integer boundaries preferred
- Mix inclusive and non-inclusive endpoints for variety
- Ensure union and intersection produce valid intervals

**For Function Questions:**

- Specify order of transformations when multiple applied
- Include both algebraic and geometric interpretations

**For Application Questions:**
