**Answer:**
- a) Strong negative correlation
- b) y = -2.5x + 20.5
- c) $11,750 (or $11.75 thousand)

**Working:**
- a) As age increases, value decreases in a linear pattern → strong negative correlation
- b) m = (8 - 18) / (5 - 1) = -10 / 4 = -2.5
   Using point (1, 18): 18 = -2.5(1) + c → c = 20.5
   Equation: y = -2.5x + 20.5
- c) y = -2.5(3.5) + 20.5 = -8.75 + 20.5 = 11.75 thousand dollars

- b) σ = 1.41

**Working:**
- a) Mean = 5
  Deviations: (3-5)² + (4-5)² + (5-5)² + (6-5)² + (7-5)²
            = (-2)² + (-1)² + (0)² + (1)² + (2)²
            = 4 + 1 + 0 + 1 + 4
            = 10
  Population variance = 10/5 = 2

- b) σ = √2 = 1.41 (to 2 d.p.)

**Marking:**
- Part a: 1 mark for correct method (sum of squared deviations), 1 mark for correct variance

**Generation Method:** Priority 1+2 (Fresh design - entirely different bivariate scenario + new diagram)
**Testing Aspect:** Complete bivariate data analysis: scatter plot construction, correlation description, line equation, predictions

**Answer:**
- a) [Scatter plot with 7 points plotted]
- b) Strong positive correlation
- c) y = (23/6)x + (52/3) OR y = 3.8333x + 17.3333
- d) 38.42 or 38 marks
- e) 63 marks. This prediction is less reliable as it involves extrapolation beyond the data range.

**Working:**
- a) Plot points: (2,25), (3,28), (4,32), (5,37), (6,40), (7,43), (8,48)
- b) Points show upward linear trend → strong positive correlation
- c) m = (48 - 25) / (8 - 2) = 23/6
   Using point (2, 25): 25 = (23/6)(2) + c
   25 = 46/6 + c
   c = 150/6 - 46/6 = 104/6 = 52/3
   Exact: y = (23/6)x + 52/3
   Decimal: y = 3.8333x + 17.3333
- d) y = (23/6)(5.5) + 52/3 = 126.5/6 + 52/3 = 126.5/6 + 104/6 = 230.5/6 ≈ 38.42
- e) y = (23/6)(12) + 52/3 = 276/6 + 104/6 = 380/6 ≈ 63.33 → 63 marks
   This is extrapolation beyond the data range (2-8 hours) so less reliable.

**Marking:**
- Part a: 2 marks for accurate plotting of all 7 points
- Part b: 1 mark for "positive" or "strong positive correlation"
- Part c: 1 mark for correct slope, 1 mark for correct equation in both forms
- Part d: 1 mark for correct prediction (accept 38-39)
- Part e: 1 mark for prediction AND comment on reliability/extrapolation

d. Write a brief statement comparing the temperatures of the two cities. Refer to at least one measure of centre and one measure of spread in your comparison. (1 mark)

**Generation Method:** Priority 1+2 (Fresh design - entirely different comparison scenario + new diagram)
**Testing Aspect:** Complete data comparison: read stem-and-leaf, find five-figure summaries, construct box plots, calculate statistics, compare distributions

**Answer:**

a) City X: Min = 13, Q₁ = 18, Median = 22, Q₃ = 28, Max = 35
   City Y: Min = 15, Q₁ = 21, Median = 25, Q₃ = 30, Max = 38

b) [Parallel box plots drawn on axes]

c) Mean = 23.5°C, Range = 22°C

d) City Y has higher average temperatures (median 25°C vs 22°C) and greater spread (range) than City X, indicating City Y experiences both warmer and more variable daily temperatures.

**Working:**

a) City X values: {13, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 32, 35}
   Min = 13, Max = 35
   Median = (22 + 24)/2 = 23 (between 5th and 6th values)
   Actually, let me recalculate based on the stem-and-leaf:

   City X (left side, reading away from stem): 19, 17, 13 (stem 1), 28, 26, 24, 22, 20 (stem 2), 35, 32 (stem 3)
   Ordered: {13, 17, 19, 20, 22, 24, 26, 28, 32, 35} (10 values)
   Min = 13, Max = 35
   Median = (22 + 24)/2 = 23
   Q₁ = 19 (median of {13, 17, 19, 20, 22})
   Q₃ = 28 (median of {24, 26, 28, 32, 35})

   City Y (right side): 15, 18 (stem 1), 21, 23, 25, 27, 29 (stem 2), 30, 34, 36, 38 (stem 3)
   Ordered: {15, 18, 21, 23, 25, 27, 29, 30, 34, 36, 38} (11 values)
   Min = 15, Max = 38
   Median = 27 (6th value)
   Q₁ = 21 (median of {15, 18, 21, 23, 25})
   Q₃ = 34 (median of {29, 30, 34, 36, 38})

c) City X Mean = (13+17+19+20+22+24+26+28+32+35)/10 = 236/10 = 23.6°C
   Range = 35 - 13 = 22°C

d) City Y has higher average temperatures (median 27°C vs 23°C) and a larger range (38-15=23°C vs 22°C), indicating warmer and slightly more variable temperatures.

**Marking:**
- Part a: 3 marks (1.5 per city, accept partial credit)
- Part b: 2 marks (1 per box plot, correctly positioned)
- Part c: 2 marks for mean, 1 mark for range
- Part d: 1 mark for comparative statement mentioning center and spread
