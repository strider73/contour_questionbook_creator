**Swimming Pool - Lane Rope Lengths**

Given: Circular pool with radius = 10 m
- Lane rope AB is 6 m from centre
- Lane rope CD is 8 m from centre

**(a)** Find length of lane rope AB [2 marks]
Using Pythagoras (half chord² + distance² = radius²):
- Let half of AB = x
- x² + 6² = 10²
- x² = 100 - 36 = 64
- x = 8 m
- **Lane rope AB = 2 × 8 = 16 m** ✓

**(b)** Find length of lane rope CD [1 mark]
- Let half of CD = y
- y² + 8² = 10²
- y² = 100 - 64 = 36

### Question 4 [4 marks]
**Circular Stadium - Spectator Viewing Angles**

Given: Stadium with centre O, spectators at A, B, C, D on boundary
∠AOB = 124° (stage area), ∠BCD = 98°

**(a)** Find angle ADB [2 marks]

Angle at centre = 2 × Angle at circumference (same arc)
∠AOB = 2 × ∠ADB
124° = 2 × ∠ADB
**∠ADB = 62°** ✓

Reason: Angle at centre is twice angle at circumference subtended by the same arc AB ✓

**(b)** Find angle DAB [2 marks]

In cyclic quadrilateral ABCD:
Opposite angles sum to 180° (cyclic quadrilateral theorem)
∠DAB + ∠BCD = 180°
∠DAB + 98° = 180°
**∠DAB = 82°** ✓

Reason: Opposite angles of a cyclic quadrilateral are supplementary ✓

---

### Question 5 [3 marks]
**Circular Pond with Footpath - Tangent-Secant Theorem**

Given: PT = 12 m (tangent from P to pond at T), PQ = 8 m

Using PT² = PA × PB (tangent-secant theorem):
- PT² = PQ × PR where R is far intersection
- 12² = 8 × PR
- 144 = 8 × PR
- PR = 18 m

**Chord TQ = PR - PQ = 18 - 8 = 10 m** ✓

Working: PT² = PQ × PR, so 144 = 8 × PR, giving PR = 18, and chord = 18 - 8 = 10 m

---

### Question 6 [3 marks]
**Alternate Segment Theorem**

Given: ∠DBE = 54°, ∠ABD = 3x + 12°

By the Alternate Segment Theorem:
The angle between a tangent and chord equals the inscribed angle subtending the same arc.

∠ABD = ∠DBE (alternate segment)
3x + 12 = 54
3x = 42
**x = 14** ✓

Reason: Alternate segment theorem - angle between tangent AC and chord BD equals the angle in the alternate segment (∠DEB) ✓
