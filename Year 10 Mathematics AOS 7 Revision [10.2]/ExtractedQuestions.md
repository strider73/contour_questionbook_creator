**Testing Aspect Variations:**

**Diagram Variations:**

## Notes for Question Generator

1. **Diagram Questions (Q6, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14, 15, 16, 17, 18)**: When generating variations, NEW DIAGRAMS MUST BE CREATED to match the new values and configurations. The testing aspect comes primarily from the DIAGRAM configuration.

2. **Text-Only Questions (Q4, 5, 7)**: Can vary numbers freely without diagram concerns. Focus on testing the same mathematical concept/formula.

3. **Multi-Part Questions**: Maintain the progression of difficulty within parts. Earlier parts often provide values needed for later parts.

4. **Tech-Active Questions (Q8, 10, 12, 14, 17)**: Require calculator use. Ensure values don't result in too-simple exact answers.

5. **Constraints**: Pay attention to answer format requirements:
   - "In terms of π" (Q6, 7, 13a)
   - "To one decimal place" (Q8)
   - "To two decimal places" (Q12)
   - "To the nearest cm²" (Q14b)

6. **Practical Context**: Some questions have real-world contexts (birthday hat, swimming pool, rocket, shadows). These can be changed to similar contexts while maintaining the mathematical structure.

7. **Testing Aspect is Key**: When creating variations, preserve WHAT is being tested (the concept, theorem, skill) even when changing the specifics (numbers, context, shapes).
