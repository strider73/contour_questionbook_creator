- **When Used**: Finding slant heights, missing dimensions in 3D shapes
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify where right triangle exists (often hidden in 3D diagram)
  2. Label the three sides: hypotenuse, opposite, adjacent
  3. Apply Pythagoras: a² + b² = c²
  4. Solve for unknown side
  5. Use this calculated value in main formula (surface area, volume, etc.)
- **Example Problem Types**:
  - Finding slant height of cone
  - Finding diagonal in rectangular prism
  - Finding perpendicular distance from centre to chord
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
  - Using wrong sides in Pythagoras
  - Confusing perpendicular height with slant height

### Strategy 5: Algebraic Setup for Circle Theorems
- **When Used**: Circle problems with expressions containing variables
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify which circle theorem applies
  2. Write the theorem relationship (equation)
  3. Substitute given expressions (e.g., x, x+7, 2x+10)
  4. Expand and simplify
  5. Rearrange to standard form (often quadratic: ax² + bx + c = 0)
  6. Solve using factoring, quadratic formula, or other method
  7. Check solutions make sense (reject negative lengths, angles > 180°, etc.)
- **Example Problem Types**:
  - Intersecting chords with variable segments
  - Tangent-secant with expressions
  - Angles expressed algebraically in cyclic quadrilaterals
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
  - Algebraic errors in expansion
  - Accepting impossible solutions (negative lengths)
  - Not checking answer in original context

### Strategy 6: Working Backwards from Required Answer
- **When Used**: Complex multi-step problems, especially "show that" questions
- **Steps**:
  1. Read what needs to be proved or found
  2. Identify what formula will give that result
  3. List what values are needed for that formula
  4. Work backwards: what do I need to find first? second?
  5. Create a solution pathway from given → intermediate → final
  6. Execute the plan forward
- **Example Problem Types**:
  - Prove two angles are equal
  - Show that a value equals specific number
  - Extension questions
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
  - Assuming what needs to be proved
  - Circular reasoning

## 6. Common Patterns

### Number Patterns Used
- **Integers**:
  - Small: 1-20 (basic problems, congruence)
  - Medium: 20-100 (intermediate calculations, angles)
  - Large: 100-1000 (surface area, volume)
- **Decimals**:
  - 1 decimal place: 1.5, 1.8, 32.0 (measurement contexts)
  - 2 decimal places: 0.5, 2.25, 38.54 (precise calculations, answers)
  - 3+ decimal places: rare, only when using π (3.14159...)
- **Fractions**:
  - Halves: 1/2 (triangle area, trapezium)
  - Thirds: 1/3 (pyramid/cone volume)
  - Unit fractions: 1/2, 1/3, 1/4 in formulas
- **Special Values**:
  - π (use calculator π button, or 3.14)
  - Common angles: 30°, 45°, 60°, 90°, 180°, 360°
  - Right angles marked with square symbol
- **Measurements**:
  - Lengths: 1-50 cm typical, up to 100 m for real-world
  - Areas: 10-500 cm²
  - Volumes: 100-2000 cm³
  - Angles: 0°-360°

### Question Formats
- **Format 1**: "Calculate/Find the [measurement] of..."
  - Diagram provided with labeled dimensions
  - May have some dimensions unlabeled (to find)
  - Answer requires calculation

- **Format 2**: "State the postulate/theorem that can be used to conclude..."
  - Diagram with marked equal sides/angles
  - Tests knowledge of congruence tests or circle theorems
  - Answer is name of theorem (SSS, Tangent Theorem 1, etc.)

- **Format 3**: "Work out the size of each angle marked with a letter. Give reasons."
  - Circle diagram with multiple angles to find
  - Requires stating which theorem used for each
  - Tests understanding of relationships

- **Format 4**: "Show that..." or "Prove that..." (Extension)
  - Requires logical reasoning
  - Must justify each step
  - Higher difficulty

- **Format 5**: "Find the value of x"
  - Diagram with algebraic expressions
  - Requires setting up equation
  - Solve for variable

- **Format 6**: "Calculate [measurement], giving your answer correct to [precision]"
  - Specifies required precision (1 d.p., 2 d.p., nearest integer)
  - Often involves π or square roots
  - Must round appropriately

### Answer Expectations
- **Exact vs Approximate**:
  - Exact when possible for angles (e.g., 126°, not 126.0°)
  - Exact for integer lengths when no π involved
  - Approximate (decimal) when π involved or specified precision
  - May leave in terms of π for some area/perimeter questions

- **Units**:
  - Always required for measurements
  - Length: cm, m (given in question)
  - Area: cm², m² (squared units)
  - Volume: cm³, m³ (cubed units)
  - Angles: ° (degrees symbol)
  - Missing units → incorrect answer

- **Significant Figures/Decimal Places**:
  - Follow question instructions ("correct to 1 decimal place")
  - If not specified, match precision of given data or use 2 d.p.
  - Angles: usually exact (no decimals unless calculated)
  - Measurements with π: 1-2 decimal places standard

- **Working Required**:
  - Yes - show all steps for complex calculations
  - Must show formula before substitution
  - Must show intermediate steps
  - "Give reasons" means state theorem names
  - Extension questions require full justification

### 7.4 Diagram Variations in Workbook

Document how the workbook varies diagrams for the same concept:

| Concept | Variation 1 | Variation 2 | Variation 3 |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| Congruent triangles | Side by side, same orientation | One rotated 180° | One reflected |
| Similar triangles | Vertical alignment (shadow) | Side by side comparison | Nested (one inside other) |
| Intersecting chords | Perpendicular intersection | Oblique intersection | One horizontal, one diagonal |
| Angle at centre | Full circle shown | Partial circle (arc visible) | With quadrilateral formed |
| Tangent problems | Single tangent horizontal | Two tangents from external point | Tangent with secant |
| Composite area | Rectangle + semicircles (horizontal) | Rectangle + quarter circles (corners) | Circle + inscribed square |
| Composite 3D | Prism + pyramid (aligned) | Cylinder + cone | Solid with hole removed |
| Cyclic quadrilateral | Square-ish in circle | Kite-like in circle | Irregular quad in circle |

#### Important Visual Recognition Notes:

1. **Shading indicates calculation target**: If region is shaded, calculate THAT area/volume
2. **Tick marks mean equality**: Same number of ticks = same length
3. **Arc marks on angles mean equality**: Same arc marks = same angle measure
4. **Dashed vs solid lines**: Dashed often means hidden/construction, solid means actual edge
5. **Centre marked with O or dot**: Identifies circle centre for radius/central angle theorems
6. **Right angle marks are critical**: Always indicates 90°, enables Pythagoras
7. **Letters establish relationships**: ∠AOB means "angle at O between points A and B"

This section ensures the question generator understands that **diagrams ARE the question** - the visual configuration indicates which theorem/formula to apply, and variations test whether students recognize the same concept in different orientations or configurations.

## Notes for Question Generation

1. **Diagram Quality is Essential**: Every geometry question REQUIRES a clear, accurate diagram. The visual representation IS the question in many cases.

2. **Progressive Difficulty**: Start with recognition/identification (basic), move to calculation with guidance (intermediate), end with independent problem-solving (advanced).

3. **Realistic Contexts**: When using real-world scenarios (shadows, buildings, containers), ensure measurements are realistic and relatable.

4. **Algebraic Progression**:
   - Basic: no algebra, direct substitution
   - Intermediate: simple linear equations, one variable
   - Advanced: quadratic equations, multiple variables, proof

5. **Answer Precision Matters**: Always specify required precision. Don't accept "approximately 38" when "38.4 m" or "38.45 m to 2 d.p." is expected.

6. **Theorem Naming Convention**: Use consistent naming (Chord Theorem 1, Angle Theorem 2, etc.) as shown in workbook.

7. **Multi-Part Questions**: Extension questions often have parts a, b, c building on each other. Part a establishes value needed for part b.

8. **"Give Reasons" Philosophy**: Students must justify angle calculations by naming the theorem used. This tests understanding, not just calculation.

9. **Composite Shape Strategy**: Always possible to break into basic shapes. The challenge is identifying which shapes and whether to add or subtract.

10. **Common Student Errors to Avoid in Answer Key**:
    - Using diameter instead of radius (or vice versa)
    - Forgetting to square radius in circle formulas
    - Confusing surface area with volume
    - Accepting negative solutions for lengths
    - Arithmetic errors with π (using 3.14 vs calculator π button)
