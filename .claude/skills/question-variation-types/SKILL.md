# Question Variation Types - Strategy Library

## Purpose

This skill provides a library of variation strategies for generating practice questions from original workbook questions. It helps create variations that test true understanding, not just memorization.

**Used by**: `question-answer-agent` when generating PRACTICE.md files

---

## 📝 EDITABLE LIBRARY

**This is a living document - update it as you discover better approaches!**

You can:
- ✏️ Add new variation types (Type 5, 6, 7...)
- ✏️ Modify existing types based on what works for your student
- ✏️ Adjust percentages and guidelines
- ✏️ Update examples to be more relevant
- ✏️ Remove types that don't test understanding effectively

## Core Principle

**Goal**: Create variations that test understanding, not just memorization

**Rule**: Generate **1 variation per original question**, choosing the BEST type to test the concept

---

## Variation Types

### Type 1: Different Numbers (Same Structure)

**When to use**:
- Basic calculation questions
- Simple data analysis
- Building confidence with familiar patterns
- Student needs practice with mechanics

**Approach**:
- Keep question structure **IDENTICAL** to original
- Change **ONLY the numerical values**
- Ensure new values create reasonable answers
- Maintain **exact same difficulty** level
- Same number of steps required

**Example**:
```markdown
Original: Calculate the range of {5, 1, 9, 12, 3, 8}
Variation: Calculate the range of {7, 2, 11, 15, 4, 9}
```

**Diagram rule**: If original has diagram, variation uses same diagram

---

### Type 2: Modified Challenge (Add Complexity)

**When to use**:
- Student shows mastery of basic concept
- Ready for slight extension of thinking
- Combining related concepts already learned
- Pushing beyond comfort zone (but still achievable)

**Approach**:
- Add **one additional requirement** (not multiple!)
- Combine with related concept student should know
- Increase data size or steps **slightly**
- Still achievable at same grade level
- Don't double the difficulty - just extend it

**Example**:
```markdown
Original: Calculate the range of {5, 1, 9, 12, 3, 8}
Variation: Calculate the range AND interquartile range (IQR) of {4, 2, 8, 15, 6, 11, 3, 9}
```

**Diagram rule**: If original has diagram, variation uses same diagram (may reference additional parts)

---

### Type 3: Reverse Pattern (Work Backwards)

**When to use**:
- Testing true understanding of relationships
- Moving beyond formula application
- Checking if student understands the "why" not just the "how"
- Deeper comprehension needed

**Approach**:
- Give the answer, ask for the input
- Work backwards from result
- Test inverse understanding
- Requires reasoning, not just calculation
- Student must understand relationship between variables

**Example**:
```markdown
Original: Calculate the range of {5, 1, 9, 12, 3, 8}
Variation: A data set has a range of 15 and a minimum value of 3. What is the maximum value?
```

**Diagram rule**: If original has diagram, variation may use diagram differently (e.g., "Given this diagram with range=15...")

---

### Type 4: Conceptual Application (Different Context)

**When to use**:
- Testing whether student understands concept vs. memorized procedure
- Checking if they can apply knowledge to new situations
- Real-world application needed
- Compare/contrast understanding

**Approach**:
- Apply same concept to new scenario
- Compare or contrast options
- Test conceptual understanding
- May change format (multiple choice, comparison, real-world context)
- Ask "why" or "explain your reasoning"

**Example**:
```markdown
Original: Calculate the range of {5, 1, 9, 12, 3, 8}
Variation: Which data set has the larger range?
- Set A: {3, 7, 11, 15}
- Set B: {5, 8, 10, 14, 18}
Explain your reasoning.
```

**Diagram rule**: If original has diagram, variation may use similar diagram type in different context

---

### Type 5: Construct & Calculate (No Diagram Given)

**When to use**:
- Testing visualization and spatial reasoning skills
- Checking if student truly understands shape properties
- Composite shapes (cylinders + cones, prisms + pyramids, etc.)
- Multi-step problems requiring geometric reasoning
- Student needs practice translating text descriptions to diagrams
- Assessing deeper understanding beyond "plug into formula"

**Approach**:
- Provide **text description only** - NO diagram given
- Include a real-world context (rocket, building, container, etc.)
- Give some dimensions directly, others must be calculated
- Require student to **draw and label** the diagram first (Part a)
- Break into sub-parts: draw → find missing dimension → calculate
- Use Pythagorean theorem or algebra to find hidden dimensions
- Final part asks for volume, surface area, or total surface area

**Structure Template**:
```markdown
**a)** Draw a labeled diagram showing all given dimensions. [1 mark]
**b)** Calculate [missing dimension using given relationships]. [1 mark]
**c)** Find [another derived measurement]. [1 mark]
**d)** Calculate the [total volume/TSA/area]. [2 marks]
```

**Example**:
```markdown
Original: A cylinder has radius 4 cm and height 10 cm. Calculate its volume.

Variation:
## The Rocket Model

A model rocket consists of a cylindrical body with a conical nose on top. The cylinder has a radius of 3 cm and a height that is unknown. The cone has the same radius as the cylinder and a slant height of 5 cm. The total height of the entire rocket is 22 cm.

**a)** Draw a labeled diagram of the rocket showing all given dimensions. [1 mark]

**b)** Calculate the perpendicular height of the cone. [1 mark]

**c)** Find the height of the cylindrical body. [1 mark]

**d)** Calculate the total volume of the rocket model. [2 marks]
```

**Common Composite Shape Scenarios**:
- Rocket/Missile: Cylinder + Cone
- Silo/Barn: Cylinder + Hemisphere
- House/Shed: Rectangular prism + Triangular prism (roof)
- Ice cream cone: Cone + Hemisphere
- Capsule/Pill: Cylinder + 2 Hemispheres
- Trophy/Cup: Cone (inverted) + Cylinder
- Storage tank: Cylinder + 2 Cones (ends)

**Diagram rule**: **NO diagram provided** - student must draw it themselves. Answer key should include the correct labeled diagram.

**Mark allocation guideline**:
- Drawing diagram: 1 mark
- Each intermediate calculation: 1 mark
- Final volume/TSA calculation: 2 marks (method + answer)

## Selecting Variation Type

### Decision Framework

**For each question, choose ONE type based on**:

1. **Question complexity**:
   - Simple calculations → Type 1
   - Multi-step problems → Type 1 or 2
   - Conceptual questions → Type 3 or 4

2. **Learning goal**:
   - Procedural practice → Type 1 or 2
   - Conceptual understanding → Type 3 or 4
   - Problem-solving skills → Type 2 or 3

3. **Student readiness**:
   - Building confidence → Type 1
   - Testing mastery → Type 2-4
   - Challenging thinking → Type 3 or 4

### Distribution Guideline

**Across all questions in a workbook, aim for approximately**:

- **~35% Type 1** (different numbers) - Build confidence and mechanical practice
- **~25% Type 2** (modified challenge) - Extend thinking slightly
- **~15% Type 3** (reverse pattern) - Test deep understanding
- **~10% Type 4** (conceptual) - Apply to new contexts
- **~15% Type 5** (construct & calculate) - Visualization and multi-step reasoning

**Note**: These are guidelines, not strict rules. Adjust based on:
- Student's current level
- Difficulty of original questions
- Time since concept was taught
- Student's confidence with topic
- **Type 5 works best for geometry/measurement topics**

## CRITICAL: Diagram Handling (Inline Creation)

### Diagram Creation Strategy by Variation Type

| Type | When to Create | Strategy | Example |
|------|----------------|----------|---------|
| **Type 1** | Never | Reuse original diagram | Square 14cm → Square 20cm (same diagram reused) |
| **Type 2** | **ALWAYS** | **CREATE NEW inline** | Square → Rectangle (new diagram created during question generation) |
| **Type 3** | Never | Reuse original diagram | Circle segment (backwards question, same diagram) |
| **Type 4** | **ALWAYS** | **CREATE NEW inline** | Circle → Ellipse (new diagram created during question generation) |
| **Type 5** | **ANSWER ONLY** | **NO diagram in question, CREATE for answer key** | Text description → Student draws → Answer key shows correct diagram |

### Implementation Details

**When**: During variation generation in question-answer-agent (Step 2)

**How**:
1. Generate variation question using this skill (question-variation-types)
2. **IF Type 2 or Type 4 AND original had diagram**:
   - Extract parameters from variation question text
   - Call diagram_utils.py to create new PNG file
   - Update markdown reference to new file: `images/diagram_q3_var_square20cm.png`
3. **ELSE (Type 1 or Type 3)**:
   - Keep original diagram reference unchanged: `images/diagram_page02_geometry.png`

**Result**: PRACTICE.md and ANSWERS.md have correct diagram references from the start (no post-processing needed)

## Domain-Specific Guidelines

### For Statistics/Data Questions

**Type 1**: Change data values, keep set size
**Type 2**: Add quartiles, IQR, standard deviation to basic questions
**Type 3**: Given mean and median, find possible data set
**Type 4**: Compare two data sets, which is more variable?

### For Probability Questions

**Type 1**: Different objects/scenarios, same probability structure
**Type 2**: Add "and then" or conditional probability
**Type 3**: Given probability, what's the sample space?
**Type 4**: Real-world scenarios (games, weather, sports)

### For Algebra Questions

**Type 1**: Different coefficients, same equation structure
**Type 2**: Add verification step or check answer
**Type 3**: Given solution, find the equation
**Type 4**: Word problems with real-world context

### For Geometry Questions

**Type 1**: Different measurements, same shape
**Type 2**: Add perimeter/area when only one was asked
**Type 3**: Given area, find dimensions
**Type 4**: Compare shapes, which has larger area/perimeter?
**Type 5**: Composite shapes described in text only - student draws, finds missing dimensions, calculates volume/TSA

**Type 5 Geometry Scenarios**:
| Real-World Context | Shapes Combined | Hidden Dimension |
|--------------------|-----------------|------------------|
| Rocket/Missile | Cylinder + Cone | Cone height (use Pythagorean with slant height) |
| Grain Silo | Cylinder + Hemisphere | Total height minus radius = cylinder height |
| House/Barn | Rectangular prism + Triangular prism | Roof height from total height |
| Ice Cream | Cone + Hemisphere | Hemisphere radius = cone radius |
| Pill/Capsule | Cylinder + 2 Hemispheres | Cylinder length = total - 2×radius |
| Water Tank | Cylinder + 2 Cones | Cone heights from slant height |
| Pencil | Cylinder + Cone (tip) | Cone height from slant height |
| Trophy Cup | Inverted cone + Cylinder base | Various from total height |
