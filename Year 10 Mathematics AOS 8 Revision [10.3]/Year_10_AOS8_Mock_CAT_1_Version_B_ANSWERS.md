## Section A: Short Answer Questions (34 Marks)

### Question 1 [1 mark]

**Generation Method:** Priority 3 - Type 1 (Different numbers)
**Testing Aspect:** x-intercepts from factored form

**Answer:** $x = -3$ and $x = 1$

**Working:**
- Set $y = 0$: $(x + 3)(x - 1) = 0$
- $x + 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -3$
- $x - 1 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 1$

**Marking:** 1 mark for both intercepts correct

---

### Question 2 [1 mark]

**Generation Method:** Priority 1+2 (Fresh - different repeated factor)
**Testing Aspect:** Counting distinct solutions

**Answer:** 3 solutions

**Working:**
- Factors: $(x-1)$ appears twice, $(x+4)$, $(x+2)$
- Distinct solutions: $x = 1, -4, -2$

**Marking:** 1 mark for answer = 3

### Question 3 [1 mark]

**Generation Method:** Priority 3 - Type 1 (Different polynomial)
**Testing Aspect:** Factor theorem verification

**Answer:** $(x+3)$ IS a factor

**Working:**
- Calculate $P(-3) = (-3)^3 + 2(-3)^2 - 7(-3) + 12$
- $= -27 + 18 + 21 + 12 = 24$

**ERROR:** With this polynomial, $P(-3) = 24 \neq 0$

**CORRECTED POLYNOMIAL:** Should be $P(x) = x^3 + 2x^2 - 7x - 12$
- Then $P(-3) = -27 + 18 + 21 - 12 = 0$ ✓

**Marking:** 1 mark for correct verification showing $P(-3) = 0$

---

### Question 4 [1 mark]

**Generation Method:** Priority 3 - Type 1
**Testing Aspect:** Zero product property

**Answer:** $x = -\frac{3}{2}, 4, -1$

**Working:**
- $2x + 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -\frac{3}{2}$
- $x - 4 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 4$
- $x + 1 = 0 \Rightarrow x = -1$

- $3a - b = 11$ ... (2)

Solve: Add (1) and (2):
- $4a = 16$, so $a = 4$
- $b = 5 - 4 = 1$

**Verification:**
- $P(x) = x^3 + 4x^2 + x - 6$
- $P(1) = 1 + 4 + 1 - 6 = 0$ ✓
- $P(-3) = -27 + 36 - 3 - 6 = 0$ ✓
