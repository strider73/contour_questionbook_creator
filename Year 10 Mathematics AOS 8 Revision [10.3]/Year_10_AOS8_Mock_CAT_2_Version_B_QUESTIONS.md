### Question 13 [5 marks]

The monthly revenue, $R$, in thousands of dollars, of a startup company is modelled by $R(x) = x^3 - 12x^2 + 27x$, where $x$ is the number of units sold, in hundreds.

a. Factorise the revenue function $R(x)$. (2 marks)

b. For what sales levels does the company earn zero revenue? (2 marks)

c. What is the revenue if 500 units are sold? (1 mark)

### Question 15 [9 marks]

Two trail elevation profiles give the vertical position (relative to a baseline) as a function of horizontal distance $x$ metres from the trailhead.

- Trail A: $y = -3(x - 3)(x - 1), x \geq 0$ (elevation in metres)
- Trail B: $y = (x - 1)(x - 2)(x - 4), x \geq 0$ (elevation in metres)

a. Where does Trail A meet the baseline (ground)? (1 mark)

b. Where does Trail B meet the baseline? (1 mark)

c. Find the horizontal distance $\bar{x}$ at which Trail A reaches its maximum elevation (give your answer in decimal form). (2 marks)

d. For which value(s) of $x$ are the two trails at the same elevation, and what is that common elevation (in metres)? (2 marks)

e. Hence or otherwise, sketch the graph of the polynomial: $y = x^3 - 7x^2 + 14x - 8$ in the interval $-1 \leq x \leq 5$. Clearly label all axis intercepts and endpoints. (3 marks)

### Question 16 [7 marks]

An investment fund models its net monthly return $R(x)$ (in thousands of dollars) by a monic cubic:

$$R(x) = x^3 + ax^2 + bx - 6$$

Where $x$ is the number of hundreds of clients in a month.

It is known that the fund breaks even when it has 200 clients, and that with 100 clients the fund produces a loss of \$8k.

a. Using this information, form two simultaneous equations in $a$ and $b$. (3 marks)

b. Solve your equations to find $a$ and $b$. (2 marks)

c. Write down the complete polynomial $R(x)$. (1 mark)

d. Hence, factor $R(x)$ fully and state all three linear factors. (1 mark)
