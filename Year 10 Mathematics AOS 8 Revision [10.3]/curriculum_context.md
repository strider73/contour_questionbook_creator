  - $a$ = the value that makes divisor equal to zero (from $x-a=0$, so $x=a$)
- **When to Use**: Finding remainder without performing full division; divisor is of form $(x-a)$
- **Example from Workbook**: Finding remainder when $f(x) = -3x^3 + 4x^2 - 5x + 12$ is divided by $2x-3$, substitute $x = \frac{3}{2}$ (Page 7)

## 5. Solution Strategies Taught

### Strategy 1: Long Division Algorithm
- **When Used**: Dividing polynomial by polynomial of degree $\geq 2$
- **Steps**:
  1. Set up division: dividend inside, divisor outside in traditional layout
  2. Divide leading term of dividend by leading term of divisor
  3. Write result above division bar
  4. Multiply entire divisor by this result
  5. Subtract from dividend (watch signs carefully)
  6. Bring down next term(s)
  7. Repeat steps 2-6 until remainder degree < divisor degree
  8. Express answer using division algorithm formula
- **Example Problem Types**: Any polynomial division, especially when divisor is degree 2+
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
  - Sign errors when subtracting
  - Forgetting to include zero coefficients for missing powers
  - Stopping too early

### Strategy 2: Synthetic Division (Short Division)
- **When Used**: Dividing polynomial by linear factor $(x-c)$
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify the root $c$ from divisor $(x-c)$
  2. Write down all coefficients of dividend (include 0 for missing terms)
  3. Set up box diagram or synthetic division layout
  4. Bring down first coefficient unchanged
  5. Multiply by root $c$, write result below next coefficient
  6. Add vertically, write sum below
  7. Repeat multiply-add pattern across all coefficients
  8. Final value is remainder, others form quotient polynomial
- **Example Problem Types**: Division by $(x-3)$, $(x+5)$, etc.
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
  - Using wrong value for $c$ (remember $x-3$ means $c=3$, not $c=-3$)
  - Misaligning columns in box method

### Strategy 3: Remainder Theorem Substitution
- **When Used**: Finding remainder without full division; solving for unknowns with remainder conditions
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify divisor form: $(x-a)$ or $(ax-b)$
  2. Solve for x-value: $x=a$ or $x=\frac{b}{a}$
  3. Substitute this value into polynomial $f(x)$
  4. Simplify arithmetic carefully (powers, fractions)
  5. Result is the remainder
  6. If finding unknown, set remainder equal to given value and solve
- **Example Problem Types**: "Find remainder when...", "Two polynomials have same remainder..."
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
  - Incorrect fraction arithmetic
  - Using wrong x-value for divisor $(ax-b)$

### Strategy 4: Factor Theorem Testing
- **When Used**: Determining if linear expression is a factor; finding unknowns given factor conditions
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify potential factor $(x-a)$
  2. Substitute $x=a$ into polynomial $f(x)$
  3. Simplify completely
  4. If result equals zero: IS a factor
  5. If result is non-zero: NOT a factor
  6. For unknown coefficients: set up equation $f(a) = 0$ and solve
- **Example Problem Types**: "Is $(x-2)$ a factor of...", "If $(x-a)$ is a factor, find..."
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
  - Arithmetic errors in substitution
  - Confusing "is a factor" (equals 0) with "has remainder" (non-zero)

### Strategy 5: Null Factor Law for Roots
- **When Used**: Finding all roots/solutions of polynomial equation in factorised form
- **Steps**:
  1. Ensure equation is set equal to zero
  2. Write in fully factorised form if not already
  3. Apply null factor law: set each distinct factor equal to zero
  4. Solve each linear equation separately
  5. List all solutions (roots)
  6. Note multiplicity if factors are repeated
- **Example Problem Types**: "Find roots of $(x-2)(x+3)(x-7)=0$"
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
  - Forgetting to list all roots
  - Not solving fractional factors correctly

### Strategy 6: Sketching Transformed Polynomial Graphs
- **When Used**: Sketching cubics/quartics in transformation form
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify form: $(x-h)^n + k$ where $n$ is degree
  2. Locate key point: POI for odd $n$, turning point for even $n$ at $(h,k)$
  3. Determine direction/shape based on coefficient $a$ and degree $n$
  4. Find y-intercept: substitute $x=0$
  5. Find x-intercepts: set $y=0$ and solve (may have 0, 1, or 2 solutions)
  6. Draw smooth curve through all points with correct shape
  7. Label all key features clearly
- **Example Problem Types**: "Sketch $y = (x+1)^3 + 8$", "Sketch $y = -(x-2)^4 + 1$"
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
  - Confusing turning point vs point of inflection
  - Not checking if x-intercepts exist (negative under even root)
  - Incorrect shape for negative coefficients

### Strategy 7: Sketching Factorised Cubics
- **When Used**: Sketching cubic graphs given in factorised form
- **Steps**:
  1. Identify all linear factors
  2. Set each factor to zero to find x-intercepts
  3. Check for repeated factors (even power = touches axis, odd power = crosses)
  4. Find y-intercept by substituting $x=0$
  5. Determine end behavior: expand leading term or check sign pattern
  6. Sketch curve crossing/touching x-axis at identified points
  7. Ensure curve has correct cubic shape (two turning points max)
- **Example Problem Types**: "Sketch $y = (x-1)(x+2)(x-3)$", "Sketch $y = (x+1)^2(x-2)$"
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
  - Missing repeated roots
  - Incorrect cubic shape (too many wiggles)
  - Wrong end behavior

### Strategy 8: Application Problem Framework
- **When Used**: Real-world polynomial modeling problems
- **Steps**:
  1. Read problem carefully, identify what is given and what is required
  2. Note any domain restrictions (e.g., $x \geq 0$ for physical quantities)
  3. For "meets ground" problems: set $y=0$ and solve
  4. For "maximum/minimum" problems: find turning point
  5. For "intersection" problems: set two functions equal
  6. Check solutions against domain restrictions
  7. Include units in final answer with context
- **Example Problem Types**: Height vs distance, structure problems, optimization
- **Common Mistakes to Avoid**:
  - Including negative solutions when physically impossible
  - Forgetting units
  - Not checking domain restrictions

| Concept/Theorem | Diagram Configuration | Key Visual Elements | How to Recognize |
|-----------------|----------------------|---------------------|------------------|
| **Cubic in POI Form** | S-shaped curve with inflection point | Single point where concavity changes; curve continuous through point | Smooth S-shape, labeled point $(h,k)$ where curve transitions from concave down to concave up (or vice versa) |
| **Quartic in Turning Point Form (Positive)** | U-shaped parabola with vertex at bottom | Vertex (turning point) at minimum; symmetric shape | Upward-opening U-shape, vertex labeled as lowest point $(h,k)$ |
| **Quartic in Turning Point Form (Negative)** | Inverted U-shape with vertex at top | Vertex (turning point) at maximum; symmetric shape | Downward-opening ∩-shape, vertex labeled as highest point $(h,k)$ |

### 7.2 Visual Elements and Their Meaning

| Visual Element | What It Indicates | Testing Aspect |
|----------------|-------------------|----------------|
| **Labeled point $(h,k)$** | Key feature location (POI or turning point) | Student must identify type based on context and calculate coordinates |

| **End behavior arrows** | Direction of graph as $x \to \pm\infty$ | Positive cubic: down-left, up-right; Negative cubic: up-left, down-right |

### 7.3 Standard Diagram Patterns by Topic

#### Cubic Graphs (POI Form):
```
Pattern: S-shaped curve with labeled inflection point

Positive Coefficient (a > 0):
- Starts from bottom-left (third quadrant)
- Curves through point of inflection
- Ends in top-right (first quadrant)
- Point of inflection is where curve "flattens" momentarily

Negative Coefficient (a < 0):
- Starts from top-left (second quadrant)
- Curves through point of inflection
- Ends in bottom-right (fourth quadrant)
- Inverted S-shape

Key Features to Mark:
├── Point of inflection $(h,k)$
├── X-intercept(s) - solve $(x-h)^3 + k = 0$
└── Y-intercept - substitute $x=0$
```

#### Quartic Graphs (Turning Point Form):
```
Pattern: Parabola-like U or ∩ shape with vertex

Positive Coefficient (a > 0):
- U-shaped (concave up)
- Vertex is minimum point
- Opens upward
- Symmetric about vertical line through vertex
- "Smiley face" ☺

Negative Coefficient (a < 0):
- ∩-shaped (concave down)
- Vertex is maximum point
- Opens downward
- Symmetric about vertical line through vertex
- "Sad face" ☹

Key Features to Mark:
├── Vertex/Turning point $(h,k)$
├── X-intercept(s) - solve $(x-h)^4 + k = 0$ (may be 0, 1, or 2)
└── Y-intercept - substitute $x=0$

Note: Flatter than quadratic parabolas due to higher degree
```

#### Factorised Cubic Graphs:
```
Pattern: Cubic with marked x-intercepts

All Distinct Factors: $(x-a)(x-b)(x-c)$
- Three separate x-intercepts
- Graph crosses x-axis at all three points
- Typical cubic shape with two turning points between roots
- No turning points on the x-axis

├── X-intercept at $(a, 0)$ - crosses
├── X-intercept at $(b, 0)$ - crosses
└── X-intercept at $(c, 0)$ - crosses

One Repeated Factor: $(x-a)^2(x-b)$
- Two x-intercepts visually
- Graph TOUCHES (but doesn't cross) at repeated root
- Graph CROSSES at distinct root
- One turning point is ON the x-axis

├── X-intercept at $(a, 0)$ - TOUCHES (turning point)
└── X-intercept at $(b, 0)$ - CROSSES

End Behavior:
- Positive leading coefficient: ↙ to ↗ (down-left to up-right)
- Negative leading coefficient: ↖ to ↘ (up-left to down-right)
```

#### Application Context Diagrams:
```
Pattern: Real-world scenario with polynomial curves

Common Setups:
1. Height vs Horizontal Distance
   - X-axis: horizontal distance (metres)
   - Y-axis: height above ground (metres)
   - Ground level at y = 0
   - Curves show structure profiles

2. Inscribed Shapes in Parabolas
   - Parabola curve with rectangle drawn inside
   - Shaded region shows area of interest
   - Dimensions labeled with variables
   - Axis of symmetry marked

Key Visual Cues:
├── Domain restrictions shown (e.g., $x \geq 0$ only first quadrant)
├── Intersection points marked where curves meet
├── Maximum/minimum points highlighted
└── Measurement labels with units (metres)
```

### 7.4 Diagram Variations in Workbook

| Concept | Variation 1 | Variation 2 | Variation 3 |
|---------|-------------|-------------|-------------|
| **Cubic POI Form** | Positive coefficient, POI in first quadrant | Negative coefficient, POI in second quadrant | Positive coefficient, POI below x-axis |
| **Quartic Turning Point** | Positive coefficient, vertex below x-axis (two x-intercepts) | Negative coefficient, vertex above x-axis (two x-intercepts) | Positive coefficient, vertex above x-axis (no x-intercepts) |
| **Factorised Cubic** | Three distinct positive roots | One repeated root (touches axis) | Mix of positive and negative roots |
| **End Behavior** | Positive cubic (rises right) | Negative cubic (falls right) | Determined by sign of leading coefficient |
| **Intercept Configurations** | Both x and y intercepts in view | Y-intercept off scale (very high/low) | No x-intercepts (quartic entirely above/below axis) |

### 7.5 Critical Visual Recognition Skills

**Students must be able to:**

1. **Distinguish POI from Turning Point**:
   - POI: curve passes THROUGH continuously, changes concavity
   - Turning Point: curve reaches max/min and reverses direction

2. **Recognize Touching vs Crossing**:
   - Touching: even multiplicity, curve bounces off x-axis
   - Crossing: odd multiplicity, curve passes through x-axis

3. **Identify Graph Type from Shape**:
   - One inflection point, no local max/min → Cubic in POI form
   - U or ∩ shape with one turning point → Quartic in vertex form
   - Multiple x-intercepts with wiggles → Factorised cubic

4. **Determine Coefficient Sign from Direction**:
   - Cubic rises to right → positive leading coefficient
   - Cubic falls to right → negative leading coefficient
   - Quartic opens up → positive leading coefficient
   - Quartic opens down → negative leading coefficient

5. **Read Coordinates from Labeled Points**:
   - Key points always labeled with coordinates $(x, y)$
   - Must transfer these to equation form correctly
   - Distinguish between given points and points to be found

### 7.6 Sketch Quality Expectations

**For full marks, graphs must show:**
- ✓ Correctly drawn and labeled axes
- ✓ Appropriate scale (usually -10 to +10 or as shown)
- ✓ ALL key features labeled with exact coordinates:
  - Turning points / Points of inflection
  - X-intercepts (where graph crosses x-axis)
  - Y-intercepts (where graph crosses y-axis)
- ✓ Correct polynomial shape (smooth curve, no corners)
- ✓ Correct end behavior (arrows showing direction)
- ✓ Proper concavity throughout
- ✓ Neat, clear presentation

**Common sketch errors to avoid:**
- ✗ Sharp corners (polynomials are smooth)
- ✗ Wrong concavity
- ✗ Unlabeled key points
- ✗ Incorrect number of turning points
- ✗ Wrong end behavior
- ✗ Not showing graph passing through calculated points
