- Can vary: Different conditions (different known points, different roots)
- Can vary: Polynomial degree (could use quadratic instead)
- Can increase difficulty: Three unknowns requiring three equations
- Key: Tests ability to translate real-world conditions into algebraic equations and solve systematically

## Notes for Question Generation

1. **Progression of Difficulty**: Questions build from basic expansion (Q1) through intermediate factorisation (Q7) to advanced applied problems (Q16).

2. **Theorem Applications**: Multiple questions test Remainder and Factor Theorems in different contexts - direct application (Q4), verification (Q8a), finding unknowns (Q11), and trial-and-error (Q14a).

3. **Factorisation Skills**: Tested progressively:
   - Direct reading (Q3)
   - Common factor + quadratic (Q13a)
   - Using known factor (Q7, Q14b)
   - From conditions (Q16d)

4. **Applied Context**: Questions 13-16 all have real-world contexts requiring interpretation and unit awareness.

5. **Graphing Skills**: Three different graphing skills tested:
   - Reading existing graph (Q5)
   - Sketching from turning point form (Q9)
   - Sketching from factorised form with interval (Q15e)

6. **Multi-step Integration**: Extended response questions (Q15, Q16) require combining multiple skills in sequence, testing problem-solving ability beyond isolated techniques.
