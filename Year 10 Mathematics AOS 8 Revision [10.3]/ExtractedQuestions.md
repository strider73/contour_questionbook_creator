**Diagram:** None

### Testing Aspect

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Concept** | x-intercepts of quadratic function in factored form |
| **Formula/Theorem** | x-intercepts occur when $y = 0$, so $(x - 2)(x - 3) = 0$ |
| **Skill Being Tested** | Identify x-intercepts directly from factored form |
| **Expected Method** | Set each factor equal to zero: $x - 2 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 2$, $x - 3 = 0 \Rightarrow x = 3$ |
| **Understanding Required** | Factored form reveals x-intercepts directly as the zeros of each factor |

### For Question Generator
- Can use any degree polynomial in fully factored form

## Question 2 [1 mark]

**Diagram:** None

### Testing Aspect

| Aspect | Details |
|--------|---------|
| **Concept** | Counting distinct solutions (zeros) of polynomial equation |
| **Formula/Theorem** | Zero product property: $ab = 0$ means $a = 0$ or $b = 0$ |
| **Skill Being Tested** | Recognize that repeated factors give the same solution |
| **Expected Method** | Identify all factors, note that $(x + 5)$ appears twice, so solutions are $x = 3, -5, 2$ (3 distinct solutions) |

| **Skill Being Tested** | Apply factor theorem by evaluating polynomial at specific value |
| **Expected Method** | Calculate $P(2) = (2)^3 - 7(2) + 6 = 8 - 14 + 6 = 0$. Since $P(2) = 0$, $(x - 2)$ is a factor |

- **Skill**: Evaluate revenue and cost at break-even points, verify they're equal
- **Expected**:
  - At $x = 1$: $R(1) = 23$, $C(1) = 23$ ✓
  - At $x = 2$: $R(2) = 44$, $C(2) = 44$ ✓
  - At $x = 6$: $R(6) = 108$, $C(6) = 108$ ✓

### For Question Generator

**Testing Aspect Variations:**
- Can use different business contexts: ticket sales, product manufacturing, service pricing
- Can vary pricing models: linear decrease, quadratic, piecewise
- Can change cost structure: different polynomial degree, include fixed costs explicitly
- Can ask for different business metrics: maximum profit (optimization), profit margin, marginal cost
- Can include domain restrictions based on realistic constraints
- Can ask for graphical interpretation: sketch profit function, identify profit/loss regions

**Key Concepts Being Tested:**
- Polynomial multiplication (revenue calculation)
- Polynomial subtraction (profit calculation)
- Factoring polynomials completely
- Solving polynomial equations (break-even)
- Evaluating and verifying in context
- Understanding business relationships through polynomial models

## Notes

- This test focuses heavily on **Year 10 polynomial concepts** (AOS 8): factored form, zeros, graphing, factor/remainder theorems, real-world modeling
- Questions progress from basic (finding intercepts) to complex (multi-step business applications)
- Four questions require graphical responses, all successfully extracted
- Extended response questions (Q14-15) test multiple related skills in context
- Total test time: 60 minutes for 50 marks (≈1.2 minutes per mark)
